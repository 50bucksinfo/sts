#####HOW DOES MY PRIVATE HEALTH WITH EXTRAS WORK FOR PAYMENT?
If you have private health cover with extras, we can claim your osteopathic consultation on the spot, so you only have to pay the difference. We accept all private health providers…too easy!
Payments accepted are cash, EFTPOS, Visa and Mastercard.

#####REFFERALL FROM MY GP – DO I NEED ONE?
Nope! Osteopaths are primary care practitioners and do not require any referral to commence consultation.
The only time you will need a referral from your treating doctor is in the case of Veteran&#8217;s Affairs scheme, Workcover and Medicare Enhanced Primary Care (EPC). Please consult your GP or call our clinic for info.

#####SHOULD I BRING MY X-RAY, CT OR MRI?
Absolutely! Please bring in any X-ray, CT or MRI scan results and reports you may have to help the osteopath manage your condition.

#####WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT AT MY CONSULTATION?
During your appointment your osteo will ask questions regarding your medical history and undertake a comprehensive examination to diagnose your condition using hands on treatment. Your osteo will provide a management strategy to best resolve your presenting health concern.

#####HOW MANY TREATMENTS WILL I REQUIRE?
An average 3-6 treatments are required, depending on the injury and your age. We recommended you see us between 2-4 times a year to keep you in tip top shape.

#####HOW LONG WILL I BE TREATED FOR?
We allow up to 45 minutes. We know your time is precious, so unlike some we do actually run on time with our appointments!

#####HOW ARE OSTEOPATHS DIFFERENT TO CHIROPRACTORS AND PHYSIOTHERAPISTS?
Osteopaths treat the same conditions as chiropractors and physiotherapists with different approaches.  If you’re  thinking you may need to see or have seen a chiropractor or physiotherapist, then seeing an osteopath is appropriate. Many of our patients have seen a vast array of therapists and prefer our osteopathic approach as we provide a hands on, holistic approach which targets a realistic prognosis.

#####CANCELLATION
We get that daily life challenges can complicate attending your appointment so we ask that should the inevitable occur, please give us at least 24-48 hours notice. This gives us a chance help another patient on our waiting list, otherwise we will ask for your assistance in covering costs of the missed appointment.
